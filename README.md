# Lambda-Function-for-releasing-Unused-Elastic-IP
This repository contains a Lambda function written in Python that identifies and releases unused Elastic IP (EIP) addresses associated with Amazon EC2 instances. When an EIP is not attached to any instance, it continues to incur costs. This Lambda function helps you deallocate unassigned EIPs, ensuring efficient resource management.
